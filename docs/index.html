  <h2>What is MiniVC?</h2>
  <p>MiniVC is a very very very minimal "MVC" framework. The reason that MVC is in quotation marks in that sentence is 
  that MiniVC is not really an MVC framework, but rather an utility for making small (very small, like the types you
  make for you cousin's CounterStrike clan at 2AM on a Tuesday) webapps. It doesn't aim to be a real framework, but
  rather help users in creating some structure in cases where otherwise your disk might be cluttered with small PHP
  files each doing a small part of a bigger task. We all hate that, right?</p>
  <p>So this is where MiniVC comes in. It's a single file you just include in the beginning of your PHP files and
  voil√°! There's no need for mod_rewrite or anything fancy-pants like that. Just plain and simple. Kind of like Britney Spears' music:
  it's simple, nobody put any real any effort into it, but in some cases it works, and you'd be embarassed to 
  tell anyone you're listening to it.</p>
  
  <h2>Installing MiniVC</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Drop minivc.php somewhere in your filesystem. Preferrably in a folder where you'll be putting PHP files to.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>That's it.</p>
  
  <h2>Configuring MiniVC</h2>
  
  <p>The beginning of the MiniVC.php file contains the configuration options in an associative array named <code>$CONF</code>.</p>
  
  <p>To configure MiniVC, edit this variable.</p>
  
  <h2>Using MiniVC</h2>
  <p>In a normal case, the MiniVC uses the following concepts: <i>controllers</i>, <i>views</i> and <i>templates</i>. And
  if you want to get all high and mighty, it might provide some support for <i>models</i> as well.</p>
  <p>If these leave you baffled and you haven't heard the concept <i>controller</i> before in this context: go away, now. 
  Seriously, don't touch this thing and go read some CakePHP documentation. I'm not kidding, here be dragons!</p>
  
  <h3>Defining controllers</h3>
  
  <p>To define a controller, create a new PHP file with the name of <i>controllername</i>.php where <i>controllername</i>
  is the <b>lowercased</b> name for the controller. In the newly created file, you need to include <code>minivc.php</code>
  and define a controller class, by extending the class (surprise, surprise) <code>Controller</code>.</p>
  
  <p>Example for creating a controller <i>users</i>.</p>
  
  <div class="codeexample">
  /* File: users.php */
  /* Require the minivc.php file. You MUST always use require_<b>once</b>() */
  require_once('minivc.php');

  class UsersController extends Controller {
  
  }
  </div>
  
  <div class="warning">
   If you include any other PHP files from your controller, you <b>must</b> use require_once() or include_once() instead
   of require() or include(), otherwise your code <b>will</b> break. This is due to how MiniVC processes the files.
  </div>
  
  <p>Now at this point your controller will still do nothing. Before it can do something, it needs some actions.
  Actions are defined as functions in the controller:</p>
  
  <div class="codeexample">
  /* File: users.php */
  /* Require the minivc.php file. You MUST always use require_<b>once</b>() */
  require_once('minivc.php');

  class UsersController extends Controller {
  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public function create() {
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* This function does some cool stuff! */
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
      
  }
  </div>
  
  <p>Now to access this function, point your browser to <code>users.php?mvcmethod=create</code>. You'll get an error about a missing view,
  but that's expected at this point.</p>
  
  <div class="note">
   You can change the name of the action parameter, it does not have to be <code>mvcmethod</code>. Read more in 
   <a href="#configuring">Configuring MiniVC</a>.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Views and templates</h2>
  
  <p>Where <i>Controllers</i> are the logic of the application, <i>views</i> and <i>templates</i> are the presentation. Each action
  needs to have it's own view, and by default MiniVC tries to find the view in PWD/views/<i>controllername</i>/<i>action</i>.php. So
  for example in the UsersController example above, the view file would be <code>./views/users/create.php</code>.</p>
  
  <p>The views get all the variables that have been set by the <code>$this->set($name, $value)</code> -method in the controller. Example:</p>
  
  <div class="codeexample">
  /* Controller code */
  $this->set("name", "Tuomas");
  
  /* View code */
  &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;?=$name?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  /* Would output &lt;p&gt;Hello Tuomas&lt;/p&gt; */
  </div>
  
  <p>The output of the view is then enclosed in a <i>template</i>. Templates are by default searched for in the path PWD/templates/<i>controllername</i>.phtml.</p>
  <div class="note">
  <div>You can edit the template name by defining a different template in the controller, by defining a variable <code>$template</code> in the class scope that defines
  the template name (without the extension).</div><div class="codeexample" style="background-color: inherit">class UsersController extends Controller {
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;var $template = "my_template";
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;...
  
  </div></div>
  
  <p>The template should contain at least the variable <code>$content_for_template</code> which is the content produced by the view and the controller. Optionally
  controllers may set the variable <code>$title_for_page</code> which will be available in the template, and should generally be used as the page &lt;title&gt;.</p>
  
  <h2>Models</h2>
  
  <p>MiniVC provides some rudimentary support for models. You do not need to define model-classes for your database objects, by you can do so by creating
  a class that extends <code>MiniVCModel</code> and storing it in PWD/models/<i>tablename</i>_model.php where tablename is the database table name this
  model refers to.</p> 
  
  <div class="warning">If you do not define models for you database tables, you will not be able to use the <code>update()</code> or <code>delete()</code> methods of the model.</div>
  
  <p>To define a model, create a file as described above and in it create a class that extends <code>MiniVCModel</code>.</p>
  
  <div class="codeexample">
  class UsersModel extends MiniVCModel {
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;/* The $primary_key variable is the most important one */
  &nbsp;&nbsp;var $primary_key = "user_id";
  
  }  
  </div>
  
  <p>By defining a <code>$primary_key</code> -variable in the model, the MiniVCModel will now be able to delete and update data easily. MiniVC does not support models
  without primary keys defined.</p>
  
  <p>When the model is defined, you can use it in the controller:</p>
  
  <div class="codeexample">
  /* Load an user with user_id of 123 */
  $object = $this->getModel("users")->load(array("user_id" => 123));
  /* Update the email */
  $object->email = "john.q.doe@example.com";
  /* Save */
  $object->update();
  </div>
  
  <p>The models always load the data so that the loaded data is set as the class members (accessing via <code>$object->{field_name}</code>).</p>
  
  <h2>Class Reference</h2>
  
  <h3>Class <code>Controller</code></h3>
  
  <h4>Class properties</h4>
  
  <p><b><code>$template</code> (string)</b></p>
  
  <p>Defines the template name to use when rendering this controller and it's view. Default: controller name</p>
  
  <p><b><code>$render_view</code> (boolean)</b></p>
  
  <p>A flag to indicate if the execution of this controller should render it's view. Default: true</p>
  
  <h4>Class methods</h4>
  
  <p><b><code>set($key, $value)</code></b></p>
  <p>Sets a variable that will be usable in the view. The $key defines the variable name in the view.</p>
  
  <p><b><code>redirect($target_url)</code></b></p>
  <p>Sends a HTTP redirect to the browser. This will automatically set <code>$render_view</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>
  
  <p><b><code>getModel($name)</code></b></p>
  <p>Returns an (empty) instance of a model with the name <code>$name</code>. If no custom model is found, returns an
  instance of MiniVCModel.</p>
  
  <p><b><code>executeSQL($sql)</code></b></p>
  
  <p>Executes an SQL-statement. If the query is a SQL <code>select</code> query, the results are returned in an array.</p>
  
  <h3>Class <code>MiniVCModel</code></h3>
  
  <h4>Class methods</h4>
  
  <p><b><code>load($conditions = array())</code></b></p>
  
  <p>Loads an item from this model that matches the given conditions.</p>
  <p>The <code>$conditions</code> should be an associative array that contains the query conditions. If you need no ordering or limiting of
  the query, then the array can contain just the conditions, as key-value -pairs with the key being mapped to the database table field name. For example:</p>
  
  <div class="codeexample">
  /* Load the user with user_id=123 */
  $user = $this->getModel("users")->load(array("user_id" => 123));
  </div>
  
  <p>If you need ordering, limiting, etc, you need can provide values for the following array keys:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>conditions</b> - As displayed above, a set of key-value -pairs to define the SQL where statement</li>
   <li><b>order</b> - An array to define the sorting of the results. Should be an associative array with they keys
   <b>field</b> and <b>direction</b>. The field should designate which field to order by, and direction defines which
   way to sort (asc or desc).</li>
   <li><b>limit</b> - To return only a set of items, use <i>limit</i>. For MiniVCModel->load() this is always 1. For loadAll() you can define this.</li>  
  </ul>
  
  <p style="color: red">XXX! TODO! There's no offset option</p>
  
  <p><b><code>loadAll($conditions = array())</code></b></p>
  
  <p>Loads all matching items from the model.</p>
  <p>The <code>$conditions</code> define the query conditions, see above for description.</p>
  <p>Returns an array containing the items, or an empty array if no items match the conditions.</p> 
  
  <p><b><code>insert($data)</code></b></p>
  <p>Insert data into the database defined by this model. The array should be an associative array defining the field names
   as keys of the array and values as the array values.</p>
  <div class="codeexample">
   /* Save data */
   $this->getModel("users")->insert(array("user_id" => 123, "name" => "John Q. Doe", "email" => "john.q.doe@example.com");
  </div>
  
  <p><b><code>update()</code></b></p>
  <p>Updates the current object's data to the database.</p>
  <div class="codeexample">
/* Load an user with user_id of 123 */
  $object = $this->getModel("users")->load(array("user_id" => 123));
  /* Update the email */
  $object->email = "john.q.doe@example.com";
  /* Save */
  $object->update();
    </div>
    <p><b><code>delete()</code></b></p>
    <p>Deletes this item from the database.</p>
    <div class="codeexample">
    $user_to_delete = $this->getModel("users")->load(array("id" => 123));
    $user_to_delete->delete();
    </div>
